The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.
Please identify the shapes, dimensions, and colors of the object based on these images according to the definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]" below.
Your answer must follow the naming convention which is "color_dimension_shape" (e.g., red_3D_cuboid or black_2D_ring).
Ensure that there is no contradiction between the shape and dimension. For example, "3D" and "circle" are not compatible according to their definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]".

[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]
Dimension
1D: One-dimensional object
2D: Two-dimensional object
3D: Three-dimensional object


Shape
1D
Line: A one-dimensional object characterized by a straight path connecting two endpoints, having a definite length but no width. If an object is with an empty center, it should not be a line.

2D
Circle: A two-dimensional round object with every point on its edge equidistant from its center
Rectangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with opposite sides equal and four right angles
Triangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with three sides and three angles
Polygon: A two-dimensional object with multiple straight sides (e.g., a pentagon is with 5 sides, a hexagon is with 6 sides)
Loop: A two-dimensional object with a closed curve characterized by an empty center, forming a continuous loop

3D
Sphere: A round three-dimensional object where every point on its surface is equidistant from its center
Cube: A three-dimensional object with six equal square faces
Cuboid: A three-dimensional object with six rectangular faces
Pyramid: A three-dimensional object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge to a single point
Cylinder: A three-dimensional object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface
Cone: A three-dimensional object with a circular base that tapers to a single point
Polyhedron: A three-dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and vertices,

Answer: black_2D_loop

Descriptions about the object in the scene:
The object in the scene is black in color and appears to be a two-dimensional loop. It has a closed curve with an empty center, forming a continuous loop. The object is positioned against a white pegboard with evenly spaced holes, which provides a clear contrast to its shape and color. The loop is irregular in shape, with varying thickness along its length, but it maintains a continuous, unbroken form. The side view confirms that the object is flat and does not have significant depth, reinforcing its classification as a 2D object. The black color is consistent throughout the object, and there are no additional features or markings on it.

The first two images are original images of black_2D_loop. Please refer to this image and answer. 
We will show the image when the robot does the action 'pull' on the object to verify the object is elastic or not.
The 3rd image shows before the robot pulls an unknown object. 
The 4th image shows while the robot pulls the object. The 5th image shows after the robot pulls the object. If the object changes in size more than twice (see image 3 and 4), and come back to its original shape(see image 3 and 5), it is said to be elastic.Does this object have elastic properties? 
Please answer with the template below:

Answer  # If there is no mention of the object's properties, fill it with False. 
**rigid: True or False
**soft: True or False
**foldable: True or False
**elastic: True or False

Reason:
-Describe a object and feel free to write down your reasons for each properties in less than 50 words

Answer  
**rigid: False
**soft: False
**foldable: False
**elastic: True

Reason:
- The object changes in size more than twice when pulled and returns to its original shape, indicating it is elastic. It is not rigid, soft, or foldable based on the observed properties.
