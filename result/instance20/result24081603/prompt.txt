Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **Yellow 3D Cylinder**: This object is cylindrical in shape and yellow in color. It is positioned horizontally in both images.
2. **White 3D Cone**: This object is conical in shape and white in color. It appears to be a cup or a similar container with a circular base and a tapering top.
3. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is cuboidal in shape and brown in color. It appears to be a sponge or a similar item with a rectangular base and height.

The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design on its sides. It is empty in both images. The objects are placed around the box, with none of them inside it. The black components visible in the images are not classified as they do not fit the given classification table.
