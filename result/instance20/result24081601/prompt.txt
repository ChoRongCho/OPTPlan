Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **Yellow 3D Cylinder**: This object is cylindrical in shape and yellow in color. It is positioned horizontally in both images.
2. **White 3D Cylinder**: This object is also cylindrical but white in color. It appears to be a cup or a similar container with a circular opening.
3. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is cuboid in shape and brown in color. It appears to be a sponge or a similar item with a rectangular base.

Additionally, there is a white box with a lattice design visible in both images. The box is empty and positioned upright.

The objects are arranged in a way that they do not overlap, making it easy to distinguish their shapes and colors. The white box is the only container in the scene, and it is currently empty.
