Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The yellow object is a 3D cylinder. It is positioned near the center of the first image and is lying horizontally in the second image.
2. The white object with a conical shape is a 3D cone. It is located near the top left in the first image and is standing upright in the second image.
3. The brown object is a 2D rectangle. It is positioned near the top center in the first image and lies flat in the second image.
4. The white box is a 3D cuboid with a lattice design. It is located near the bottom right in the first image and is standing upright in the second image.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to identify and classify them according to the given table.
