Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The images show a collection of objects from different perspectives. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects are as follows:

1. A yellow cylindrical object, which is a 3D shape, is visible in both images. It is positioned near the center in the first image and to the right of the white box in the second image.
2. A white circular object, which is a 2D shape, is seen in both images. It is located at the top left in the first image and to the right of the yellow cylinder in the second image.
3. A brown rectangular object, which is a 2D shape, is also present in both images. It is positioned near the top center in the first image and in front of the white box in the second image.
4. A white box with a lattice design, which is a 3D shape, is visible in both images. It is located at the bottom right in the first image and to the left of the yellow cylinder in the second image.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to identify and classify them.
