Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The objects include a white box, a yellow cylinder, a white cone, and a brown cuboid. The white box has a lattice design and is empty. The yellow cylinder is placed horizontally next to the box. The white cone, which appears to be a cup or a similar object, is placed near the yellow cylinder. The brown cuboid, which looks like a sponge, is placed above the yellow cylinder. The objects are arranged in a way that they do not overlap each other, making it easy to distinguish their shapes and colors. The white box is the only container in the scene, and it is empty. The yellow cylinder, white cone, and brown cuboid are placed outside the box.
