Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. The white box is a 3D object with a lattice structure. It is positioned on the right side of the images. Inside this box, there is a black 3D cylinder, which appears to be a roll of tape or a similar object.

2. Outside the box, there is a brown 3D cuboid, which looks like a sponge or a block. It is positioned to the left of the white box in both images.

3. Additionally, there is a white 2D circle, which is a flat, circular object. It is located near the center of the images, slightly towards the bottom in the second image.

These objects are arranged on a flat surface, and their colors and shapes are clearly distinguishable in both images.
