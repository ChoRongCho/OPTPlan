Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **White Box**: There is a white box with a lattice design. It is positioned towards the right side of the images. The box is empty except for one object inside it.
2. **Black 3D Cylinder**: Inside the white box, there is a black cylindrical object. This object is clearly visible in both images.
3. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: Outside the box, there is a brown cuboid object. It is positioned to the left of the white box. The cuboid has a sponge-like texture.
4. **White 2D Circle**: There is a white circular object placed flat on the surface. It is located near the center of the images and appears to be a flat, disc-like object.

These objects are arranged on a light-colored surface, and the images capture their relative positions and orientations.
