Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. The white box is located on the right side of the images. It is a 3D object with a lattice structure.
2. Inside the white box, there is a black cylindrical object. This object is a 3D cylinder.
3. Outside the box, there is a brown cuboid object, which appears to be a sponge. This object is a 3D cuboid.
4. Also outside the box, there is a white circular object, which is flat and appears to be a lid or a disc. This object is a 2D circle.

The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images capture the same scene from different perspectives, allowing for the identification and classification of the objects based on their shapes and colors.
