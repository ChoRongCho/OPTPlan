Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box is located towards the right side of the images. Inside the box, there is a black object that appears to be a loop, which is a 2D shape. Outside the box, there are two objects. The first object is a red polyhedron, which resembles a dragon-like figure with wings and a tail. This object is 3D and has a complex shape. The second object is a yellow rectangle, which is flat and 2D. The yellow rectangle is positioned to the left of the white box. The images provide both a top view and a side view of the scene, allowing for a clear identification of the objects and their respective shapes and colors.
