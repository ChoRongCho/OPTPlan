Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. The object closest to the center of the first image is a red 3D polyhedron with yellow wings and details. This object is also visible in the second image, lying on its side.
2. To the left of the red polyhedron in the first image is a yellow 2D rectangle, which is flat and appears to be a piece of fabric or paper. This object is also visible in the second image, lying flat on the surface.
3. In the first image, there is a white box with a lattice design on the right side. Inside this box, there is a black 2D loop, which appears to be a roll of tape. This box and its contents are also visible in the second image.

The white box is empty except for the black 2D loop inside it. The red 3D polyhedron and the yellow 2D rectangle are outside the box.
