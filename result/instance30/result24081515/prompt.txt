Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their color, dimensions, and shape.
Please identify the shapes, dimensions, and colors of the object based on these images according to the definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]" below.
Your answer must follow the naming convention which is "color_dimension_shape" (e.g., red_3D_cuboid or black_2D_ring).
Ensure that there is no contradiction between the shape and dimension. For example, "3D" and "circle" are not compatible according to their definitions in "[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]".


[Definitions of dimensions and shapes]
Dimension
1D: One-dimensional object, such as thin and sharp thing
2D: Two-dimensional object, without height
3D: Three-dimensional object


Shape
1D
Line: A one-dimensional object characterized by a straight path connecting two endpoints, having a definite length but no width. If an object is with an empty center, it should not be a line.

2D
Circle: A two-dimensional round object with every point on its edge equidistant from its center
Rectangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with opposite sides equal and four right angles
Triangle: A two-dimensional polygonal object with three sides and three angles
Polygon: A two-dimensional object with multiple straight sides (e.g., a pentagon is with 5 sides, a hexagon is with 6 sides)
Loop: A two-dimensional object with a closed curve characterized by an empty center, forming a continuous loop

3D
Sphere: A round three-dimensional object where every point on its surface is equidistant from its center
Cube: A three-dimensional object with six equal square faces
Cuboid: A three-dimensional object with six rectangular faces
Pyramid: A three-dimensional object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge to a single point
Cylinder: A three-dimensional object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface
Cone: A three-dimensional object with a circular base that tapers to a single point
Polyhedron: A three-dimensional object with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and vertices,

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains three main objects and a white box. The objects are as follows:
1. A red three-dimensional polyhedron resembling a dragon with yellow wings and spikes. It is located outside the box.
2. A yellow two-dimensional rectangle, which appears to be a flat piece of material. It is also located outside the box.
3. A black two-dimensional loop, which is inside the white box. The loop has an empty center, forming a continuous loop.

The white box is open and has a lattice design on its sides. The objects are placed on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view of the scene, ensuring accurate identification of the objects' dimensions and shapes.
