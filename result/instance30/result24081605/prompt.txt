Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. **Red 3D Polyhedron**: This object is a red plush toy resembling a dragon. It has a complex shape with wings and a tail, making it best classified as a polyhedron. It is located outside the box in both images.
   
2. **Yellow 2D Rectangle**: This object is a flat, yellow rectangular piece of fabric or paper. It is also outside the box in both images.

3. **Black 2D Loop**: This object is a black circular loop, possibly a roll of tape. It is located inside the white box in both images.

4. **White Box**: The box itself is white and has a lattice design on its sides. It contains the black 2D loop.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, and their positions are consistent between the two images.
