Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a red 3D polyhedron, which appears to be a plush toy with yellow wings and details. This object is located outside the box. There is also a yellow 2D rectangle, which seems to be a flat piece of material, also outside the box. Inside the white box, there is a black 2D loop, which appears to be a roll of tape or a similar circular object. The white box itself is open and has a lattice design on its sides. The objects correspond one-to-one between the two images, with the top view showing their positions and the side view providing additional perspective on their shapes and dimensions.
