Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The objects include a yellow 3D cylinder, a yellow 2D rectangle, a transparent 2D circle, and a black 3D cuboid. The white box is empty and has a lattice design. The yellow 3D cylinder is positioned vertically and has a smooth surface. The yellow 2D rectangle is flat and appears to be a piece of fabric or paper. The transparent 2D circle is flat and has a smooth surface, likely made of plastic or glass. The black 3D cuboid is solid and has a rectangular shape with defined edges. The white box is empty and has a lattice design, providing a clear view of its contents.
