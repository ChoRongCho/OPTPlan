Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The first object, located towards the left in both images, is a yellow 2D rectangle. It appears flat and rectangular in shape.
2. The second object, positioned near the center in the first image and towards the bottom in the second image, is a transparent 2D circle. It is flat and circular.
3. The third object, found near the bottom center in the first image and lying horizontally in the second image, is a yellow 3D cylinder. It has a cylindrical shape and is yellow in color.
4. The fourth object is a white box, which is empty. It is visible towards the right in both images.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, and they correspond one-to-one between the two images. The white box is empty, and the other objects are placed outside of it.
