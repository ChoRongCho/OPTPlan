Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **Yellow 2D Rectangle**: This object is a flat, yellow rectangle, likely made of a soft material. It is positioned on the left side of the images.
2. **Transparent 2D Circle**: This object is a flat, transparent circle, located near the center of the images. It appears to be made of a thin, plastic-like material.
3. **Yellow 3D Cylinder**: This object is a yellow cylinder, positioned vertically in the first image and horizontally in the second image. It has a solid, three-dimensional shape.
4. **White Box**: This is a white box with a lattice design, located on the right side of the images. It is empty in both images.

The objects are arranged in a way that allows for easy identification of their shapes and colors. The yellow rectangle and transparent circle are flat (2D), while the yellow cylinder is a three-dimensional object (3D). The white box is also a three-dimensional object but is not classified as it is the container.
