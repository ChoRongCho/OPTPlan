Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **Yellow 2D Rectangle**: This object is a flat, yellow rectangle located towards the left side of the images. It appears to be a piece of fabric or paper.

2. **Transparent 2D Circle**: Positioned near the center of the images, this object is a flat, transparent circle. It is likely made of plastic or a similar material.

3. **Yellow 3D Cylinder**: This object is a yellow cylinder, positioned vertically in the first image and horizontally in the second image. It has a yellow cap and a slightly transparent body, indicating it might be a container or bottle.

4. **White Box**: The white box is located towards the right side of the images. It has a lattice design and is empty in both images.

These objects are arranged on a light-colored surface, with some mechanical components visible on the left and right edges of the images.
