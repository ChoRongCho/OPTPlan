Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects and a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is empty in the second image but contains a black loop in the first image. The black loop is a 2D object, classified as a loop. Outside the box, there is a black cylinder, which is a roll of tape, and it is classified as a 3D cylinder. Additionally, there is a white loop, which is a 2D object, lying on the surface next to the box. The black cylinder and the white loop are both visible in both images, with the black cylinder being closer to the bottom left corner and the white loop being closer to the center of the images. The white box is positioned towards the right side of the images.
