Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects and a white box. The white box is located towards the right side of the images. Inside the white box, there is a black object that appears to be a loop, which is classified as a 2D loop. Outside the box, there are two objects: a white loop and a black cylinder. The white loop is positioned near the center of the images, and it is classified as a 2D loop. The black cylinder is located towards the bottom left of the images, and it is classified as a 3D cylinder. The white box has a lattice design on its sides, and it is empty except for the black loop inside it. The objects are placed on a light-colored surface, and there is a robotic arm visible on the right side of the images.
