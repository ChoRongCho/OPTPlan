Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is empty. Outside the box, there are several objects:

1. A red 3D polyhedron resembling a dragon with yellow wings and details.
2. A yellow 3D cylinder with a green section in the middle.
3. A green 3D cylinder, which appears to be a cap or lid.
4. A white 2D loop, likely an elastic band.
5. A black 2D loop, also likely an elastic band.

The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the second image provides a side view, confirming the shapes and colors of the objects. The red polyhedron is the most prominent object, and the yellow cylinder is positioned next to it. The green cylinder is small and placed near the yellow cylinder. The white and black loops are thin and flexible, lying flat on the surface.
