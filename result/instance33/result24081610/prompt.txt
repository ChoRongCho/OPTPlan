Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains several objects both inside and outside a white box. The white box is visible in both images and has a lattice design.

1. **Red 3D Polyhedron**: This object is a red plush toy with yellow wings, resembling a dragon. It is located outside the box.
2. **Green 3D Cylinder**: This object is a small green cap-like item. It is located outside the box.
3. **Yellow 3D Cylinder**: This object is a yellow cylindrical container with a transparent middle section. It is located outside the box.
4. **White 2D Loop**: This object is a white elastic band forming a loop. It is located outside the box.
5. **Black 2D Loop**: This object is a black elastic band forming a loop. It is located inside the box.

The objects are arranged in a way that allows for easy identification of their shapes and colors. The white box serves as a container for the black 2D loop, while the other objects are placed around it.
