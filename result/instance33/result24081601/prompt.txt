Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects, some inside a white box and others outside. The white box is empty. Outside the box, there is a red 3D polyhedron resembling a dragon, a yellow 3D cylinder, a green 3D cylinder, a white 2D loop, and a black 2D loop. The red polyhedron has a complex shape with wings and a tail, making it look like a dragon. The yellow cylinder appears to be a container with a green section in the middle. The green cylinder is smaller and looks like a cap or lid. The white loop and black loop are elastic bands or similar objects. The white box has a lattice design on its sides.
