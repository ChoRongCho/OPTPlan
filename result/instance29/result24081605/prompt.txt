Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. The red object with yellow wings and details is a 3D polyhedron. It is positioned near the center of the first image and is lying on the surface in the second image.
2. The black object with a beige center is a 3D cylinder. It is located towards the top left in the first image and is placed on the surface in the second image.
3. The white object with a circular shape is a 2D circle. It is positioned towards the bottom left in the first image and is placed on the surface in the second image.
4. The white box with a lattice design is a 3D cuboid. It is located towards the bottom right in the first image and is placed on the surface in the second image.

The white box is empty, and the other objects are placed outside the box.
