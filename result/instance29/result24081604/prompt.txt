Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The objects are as follows:

1. A red object resembling a dragon, which is a 3D polyhedron due to its complex shape and volume.
2. A black object that appears to be a roll of tape, which is a 3D cylinder.
3. A white object that looks like a paper plate, which is a 2D circle.
4. A white box with a lattice design, which is empty.

The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. The objects are positioned similarly in both images, allowing for easy identification and matching. The white box is empty in both images, and the other objects are placed outside the box.
