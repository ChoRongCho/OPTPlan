Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The red object, which appears to be a stuffed toy, is closest to the center of the first image. It has a complex shape and can be classified as a red_3D_polyhedron.
2. There is a black object that appears to be a roll of tape. It is cylindrical in shape and can be classified as a black_3D_cylinder.
3. A white object that looks like a paper plate is also present. It is flat and circular, fitting the classification of a white_2D_circle.
4. The white box is visible in both images. It has a lattice design and is empty in both views.

The objects are arranged around the white box, with the red stuffed toy and the black roll of tape placed outside the box. The white paper plate is also outside the box.
