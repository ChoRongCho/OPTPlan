Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The red object with yellow wings and details is a 3D polyhedron. It is positioned near the center of the images and is not inside the box.
2. The black object with a beige center is a 3D cylinder. It is located to the left of the red polyhedron in the first image and is also outside the box.
3. The white object with a circular shape is a 2D circle. It is placed below the red polyhedron in the first image and is outside the box.
4. The white box with a lattice design is empty and positioned to the right of the red polyhedron in the first image.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, making it easy to classify them according to the provided table.
