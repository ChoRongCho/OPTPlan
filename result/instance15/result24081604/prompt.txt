Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The white box is located on the right side of the images. Inside the white box, there is a green 3D sphere and a white 2D loop. Outside the box, there is a brown 3D cuboid, which appears to be a sponge, a white 3D cylinder, which looks like a cup or bowl, and a black 1D line, which seems to be a cable or cord. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the second image provides a side view, confirming the shapes and colors of the objects. The white box has a lattice design on its sides.
