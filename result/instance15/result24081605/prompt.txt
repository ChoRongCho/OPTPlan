Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a variety of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The white box is located on the right side of the images. Inside the box, there is a green 3D sphere and a white 2D loop.
2. Outside the box, there is a brown 3D cuboid, which appears to be a sponge, located towards the center-left of the images.
3. A white 3D cylinder, which looks like a cup or a bowl, is placed near the bottom center of the images.
4. A black 2D loop, which seems to be a rubber band, is located towards the top left of the images.

The white box has a lattice design and is positioned towards the right side of the images. The objects are well-distributed around the box, with the green sphere and white loop inside it.
