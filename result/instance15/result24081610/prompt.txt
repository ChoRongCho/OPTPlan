Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects from different perspectives. The white box is located in the bottom right corner of the first image and the center of the second image. Inside the box, there is a small green object that is spherical in shape (3D_sphere) and a white loop (2D_loop). Outside the box, there is a brown cuboid (3D_cuboid) which appears to be a sponge, a white cylindrical object (3D_cylinder) which looks like a cup or container, and a gray loop (2D_loop) which seems to be a cord or band. The white box has a lattice design on its sides. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the second image provides a side view that helps in identifying the dimensions and shapes of the objects more clearly.
