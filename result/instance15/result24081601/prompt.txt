Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a variety of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **Green 3D Sphere**: This object is small, green, and spherical. It is located inside the white box.
2. **White 2D Loop**: This object is a white loop, also located inside the white box.
3. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is a brown cuboid, resembling a sponge or block, and is placed outside the box.
4. **Black 2D Loop**: This object is a black loop, placed outside the box.
5. **White 3D Cylinder**: This object is a white cylinder, resembling a cup or bowl, and is placed outside the box.
6. **White Box**: The box itself is white and contains the green sphere and white loop.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to classify them according to the provided table.
