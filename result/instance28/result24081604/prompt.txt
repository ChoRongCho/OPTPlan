Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is located at the top center of the first image and at the front center of the second image. It is brown in color and has a rectangular shape, indicating it is a cuboid.

2. **White 3D Cuboid**: This object is located at the bottom left of the first image and at the right side of the second image. It is white in color and has a bowl-like shape, indicating it is a cuboid.

3. **Black 3D Cylinder**: This object is inside the white box in both images. It is black in color and has a cylindrical shape.

4. **White Box**: This object is located at the bottom right of the first image and at the left side of the second image. It is white in color and has a cuboid shape with a lattice design. 

The objects are classified based on their dimensions and shapes according to the provided classification table.
