Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a brown cuboid, a white circle, a black cylinder, and a white box.

The brown cuboid is located outside the box and has a rectangular shape with a 3D volume, making it a 3D_cuboid. The white circle is also outside the box and appears flat, classifying it as a 2D_circle. The black cylinder is inside the white box and has a cylindrical shape with a 3D volume, making it a 3D_cylinder. The white box is a container with a lattice design and is used to hold the black cylinder.

The brown cuboid is positioned at the top of the images, the white circle is near the bottom left, and the white box containing the black cylinder is on the right side of the images. The white box is the only container in the scene, and it is white in color.
