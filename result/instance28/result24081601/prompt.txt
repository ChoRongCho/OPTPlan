Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a white box, a brown cuboid, a white circle, and a black cylinder.

The white box is located on the right side of the images. It is a 3D object with a lattice design, and it is empty in the first image but contains a black cylinder in the second image.

The brown cuboid is positioned at the top of the images. It is a 3D object with a rectangular shape and a brown color.

The white circle is located to the left of the white box in the images. It is a 2D object with a circular shape and a white color.

The black cylinder is inside the white box in the second image. It is a 3D object with a cylindrical shape and a black color.
