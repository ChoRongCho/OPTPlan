Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a white box, a brown cuboid, a white cylinder, and a black cylinder.

1. The white box is located on the right side of the images. It has a lattice design and is open at the top.
2. Inside the white box, there is a black cylinder. This object is black and has a cylindrical shape.
3. Outside the box, there is a brown cuboid. This object is brown and has a rectangular cuboid shape.
4. Also outside the box, there is a white cylinder. This object is white and has a cylindrical shape.

The brown cuboid is positioned at the top of the images, while the white cylinder is placed next to the white box. The black cylinder is inside the white box. The white box is the only container in the scene, and it is white in color.
