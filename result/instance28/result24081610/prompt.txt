Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is a brown sponge-like material with a rectangular shape, making it a cuboid. It is located outside the box in both images.
2. **White 3D Cuboid**: This object is a white bowl-like structure with a fluted design, giving it a cuboid shape. It is also outside the box in both images.
3. **Black 3D Cylinder**: This object is a black roll of tape, cylindrical in shape. It is placed inside the white box in both images.
4. **White Box**: The box itself is white and has a lattice design. It contains the black 3D cylinder.

The objects correspond one-to-one between the two images, with the brown cuboid and white cuboid outside the box, and the black cylinder inside the white box.
