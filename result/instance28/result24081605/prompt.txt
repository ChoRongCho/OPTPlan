Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a white box, a brown cuboid, a white cylinder, and a black cylinder.

The white box is located on the right side of the images. It has a lattice design and is empty except for a black cylinder inside it. The black cylinder is also visible in the side view, confirming its presence inside the box.

Outside the box, there is a brown cuboid, which appears to be a sponge or foam material. It is rectangular in shape and has a rough texture. This object is located at the top of the images.

Additionally, there is a white cylinder, which looks like a bowl or a cup. It is placed next to the white box and is visible in both the top and side views.

The objects are classified based on their dimensions and shapes as per the given classification table. The brown cuboid is a 3D object with a rectangular shape, the white cylinder is a 3D object with a cylindrical shape, and the black cylinder inside the box is also a 3D object with a cylindrical shape.
