Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is positioned on the right side of the images. Inside the box, there is a transparent object that appears to be cylindrical in shape, likely a small bottle or container. Outside the box, there are two objects: a brown cuboid, which looks like a sponge, and a blue loop, which appears to be an elastic band or similar item. The brown cuboid has a rough texture and is rectangular in shape, while the blue loop is a simple closed curve. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view of the scene, allowing for a clear identification of the shapes and colors of the objects.
