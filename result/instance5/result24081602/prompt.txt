Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. The object closest to the center of the images is a brown 3D cuboid. It appears to be a sponge or foam block with a rectangular shape and a brownish color.
2. There is a blue 2D loop, which looks like a rubber band or a looped string, lying next to the cuboid.
3. A white box is present in the scene. It has a lattice design and is open at the top.
4. Inside the white box, there is a transparent 3D cylinder, which appears to be a small bottle or container.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to classify them according to the given table. The brown cuboid and blue loop are outside the box, while the transparent cylinder is inside the white box.
