Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The scene contains a few distinct objects. The first object is a yellow 3D cuboid, which appears to be a sponge. It is rectangular in shape and has a volume, making it a cuboid. The second object is a blue 2D loop, which is a circular band or loop lying flat on the surface. The third object is a transparent 3D cylinder, which is a small bottle placed inside a white box. The box itself is white and has a lattice design on its sides. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, with the yellow cuboid and blue loop outside the box, and the transparent cylinder inside the box.
