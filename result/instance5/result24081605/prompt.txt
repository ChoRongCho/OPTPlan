Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene are as follows:

1. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is a brown sponge-like material with a cuboid shape. It is positioned near the center of the first image and in front of the white box in the second image.

2. **Blue 2D Loop**: This object is a blue loop, likely made of elastic material. It is located to the left of the white box in both images.

3. **Transparent 3D Cylinder**: This object is a transparent cylindrical container, which is placed inside the white box. It is visible through the lattice structure of the box in both images.

4. **White Box**: The box is white and has a lattice structure. It is positioned on the right side of the images. The transparent cylindrical container is inside this box.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, making it easy to classify them according to the provided table.
