Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene correspond between the two images.

1. The object closest to the center of the first image is a brown 3D cuboid. It appears to be a sponge or a similar object with a rectangular shape and volume.
2. To the left of the cuboid, there is a blue 2D loop. This object is circular and flat, resembling a rubber band or a hair tie.
3. In the white box, there is a transparent 3D cylinder. This object looks like a small bottle or container with a cylindrical shape and volume.
4. The white box itself is visible in both images. It is a white box with a lattice design on its sides.

The objects are classified based on their dimensions and shapes according to the provided classification table. The brown cuboid is a 3D object with volume, the blue loop is a 2D object with a flat circular shape, and the transparent cylinder is a 3D object with volume.
