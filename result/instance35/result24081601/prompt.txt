Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. The objects are as follows:

1. A brown 3D cuboid, which appears to be a sponge or foam block, is located at the top left of the images.
2. A black 2D circle, which seems to be a roll of tape, is positioned near the top right of the images.
3. A red 3D polyhedron, which looks like a plush toy or figurine, is situated towards the bottom left of the images.
4. A yellow 3D cylinder, which appears to be a roll of some material, is placed near the center-right of the images.

Additionally, there is a white box with a lattice design, which is empty in both images. The box is located towards the center-right of the images. The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, making it easy to identify and classify them according to the given classification table.
