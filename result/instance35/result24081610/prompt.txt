Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a variety of objects placed around a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is empty. Outside the box, there are several objects:

1. A yellow 3D cylinder, which appears to be a roll of tape or similar object.
2. A red 3D polyhedron, which resembles a plush toy or figurine with wings.
3. A black 2D loop, which is a roll of black tape.
4. A brown 3D cuboid, which looks like a piece of sponge or foam.

The objects are arranged in a way that they are easily distinguishable in both the top and side views. The white box is empty and has a lattice design on its sides.
