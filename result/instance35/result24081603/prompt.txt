Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is a brown sponge-like material with a cuboid shape. It is located at the top left of the first image and at the bottom right in the second image.
2. **Black 2D Circle**: This object is a black roll of tape, which appears as a circle from the top view. It is located at the top right of the first image and at the bottom left in the second image.
3. **Red 3D Polyhedron**: This object is a red plush toy with yellow wings, resembling a dragon. It has a complex polyhedral shape. It is located at the bottom left of the first image and at the bottom right in the second image.
4. **Yellow 3D Cylinder**: This object is a yellow cylindrical container with a green stripe. It is located to the right of the red plush toy in the first image and in the center of the second image.
5. **White Box**: This is a white plastic box with a lattice design. It is empty and located at the right side of the first image and the left side in the second image.
