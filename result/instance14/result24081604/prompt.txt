Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is located towards the bottom right of the first image and the top left of the second image. Inside the box, there are two loops: one is white and the other is black. These loops are flat and circular, classifying them as 2D loops.

Outside the box, there are two cylindrical objects. One is a white cylinder, which appears to be a bowl or cup, and the other is a black cylinder, which looks like a roll of tape. The white cylinder is located towards the bottom left of the second image and the top right of the first image. The black cylinder is located towards the bottom right of the second image and the top left of the first image. Both of these objects have volume, classifying them as 3D cylinders.
