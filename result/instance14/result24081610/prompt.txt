Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Please answer with the template below:

Answer
---
object in box:  # if nothing is in the box, leave this answer blank
object out box: brown_3D_cuboid, black_3D_circle  # this is an example
box: white_box # specify only the color of the box

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene correspond between the two images.

1. The white box is visible in both images. It is a white box with a lattice design.
2. Inside the white box, there are two loops: one white and one blue. These loops are 2D shapes.
3. Outside the box, there is a white 3D cylinder, which appears to be a bowl or cup. It is white and has a cylindrical shape.
4. There is also a black 3D cylinder outside the box, which appears to be a roll of tape. It is black and cylindrical.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, and their dimensions are classified according to the provided table.
