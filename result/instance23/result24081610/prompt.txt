Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. In the first image, a top view is provided, while the second image offers a side view. The objects correspond one-to-one between the two images.

1. The first object, which is red with yellow wings, appears to be a plush toy. Based on its volume and shape, it can be classified as a red_3D_polyhedron.
2. The second object, which is green and appears to be a cap or lid, is cylindrical in shape. It can be classified as a green_3D_cylinder.

The white box is visible in both images. In the first image, the box is positioned towards the bottom right, and in the second image, it is located towards the left side. The box is empty in both images.
