Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the given images, there are three main objects and a box. The box is white and has a lattice design. It is empty in both images. 

The first object is a red 3D polyhedron, which appears to be a plush toy with wings. It is positioned outside the box in both images. The toy has yellow wings and a yellow pattern along its back, adding to its distinct appearance.

The second object is a green 3D cylinder, which looks like a small cap or lid. It is also outside the box in both images. The cylinder is green and has a translucent quality, making it easy to identify.

The white box is empty and has a lattice design, which is visible in both images. The box is positioned on the right side of the images, and it is clear that no objects are inside it.

These objects are positioned on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view, allowing for a clear understanding of their shapes and colors.
