Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the given images, there are three main objects and a box. The box is white and has a lattice design. The first object is a red 3D polyhedron, which appears to be a plush toy with wings. It is positioned outside the box in both images. The second object is a green 3D cylinder, which looks like a cap or a small container. This object is also outside the box in both images. The third object is a yellowish-brown item inside the box, but its shape and classification are not clear from the images provided. The white box is empty except for this yellowish-brown item. The scene is captured from a top view in the first image and a side view in the second image, providing different perspectives of the same objects.
