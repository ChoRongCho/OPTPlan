Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. In both images, there is a white box with a lattice design. The box is empty in both images. Outside the box, there are two distinct objects. 

The first object is a red 3D polyhedron, which appears to be a plush toy with wings. It has a complex shape that fits the classification of a polyhedron due to its multiple faces and three-dimensional structure. The second object is a green 3D cylinder, which appears to be a small, round object with a flat top and bottom, fitting the classification of a cylinder.

The white box is positioned to the right in both images. The red polyhedron is placed to the left of the box in the first image and in front of the box in the second image. The green cylinder is positioned above the box in the first image and in front of the box in the second image. The scene is well-lit, and the objects are clearly visible against the light-colored background.
