Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the given images, there are three main objects and a white box. The first object is a red 3D sphere with additional features resembling a dragon, which is located outside the box. The second object is a yellow 3D cylinder, which is also outside the box. The third object is a white box with a lattice design. The red sphere has yellow wings and a tail, adding to its distinct appearance. The yellow cylinder has a greenish section in the middle, giving it a two-tone look. The white box is empty and has a lattice pattern on its sides, making it easy to identify. The images show the objects from different angles, providing a clear view of their shapes and colors.
