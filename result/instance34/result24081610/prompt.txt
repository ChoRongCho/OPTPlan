Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, including a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is empty in both images. Outside the box, there are two main objects. The first object is a red 3D sphere with yellow wings, resembling a dragon. The second object is a yellow 3D cylinder, which appears to be a container or tube. The red sphere is plush and has additional features like eyes and wings, while the yellow cylinder has a transparent section in the middle. The objects are positioned differently in the two images, but they correspond one-to-one between the images. The white box is empty and has a lattice design on its sides.
