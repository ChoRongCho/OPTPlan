Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with three main objects and a white box. The first object is a red 3D sphere with additional features resembling wings and a tail, which is located outside the box. The second object is a yellow 3D cylinder with some green and transparent sections, also located outside the box. The third object is a white box with a lattice design, which is empty. The first image provides a top view, while the second image provides a side view of the same scene. The red 3D sphere and the yellow 3D cylinder are positioned near the white box in both images. The white box is empty in both views.
