Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with three main objects and a white box. The first object is a red 3D polyhedron, which appears to be a plush toy with yellow wings and a tail. The second object is a yellow 3D cylinder, which looks like a container or a tube. The third object is a white box with a lattice design on its sides. 

In the first image, the red 3D polyhedron is positioned to the left of the white box, and the yellow 3D cylinder is above the box. The white box is empty and has a circular object with a loop inside it. In the second image, the red 3D polyhedron is lying on the surface to the right of the white box, and the yellow 3D cylinder is in front of the box. The white box remains empty in this view as well.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, making it easy to identify and classify them according to the given classification table. The red 3D polyhedron and yellow 3D cylinder are outside the box, while the white box itself is empty.
