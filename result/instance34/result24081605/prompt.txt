Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the provided images, there are three main objects and a white box. The first object is a red plush toy with yellow wings, which can be classified as a red_3D_sphere due to its overall rounded shape. The second object is a yellow cylindrical container, which is a yellow_3D_cylinder. The third object is a white box with a lattice design, which is simply referred to as a white_box. 

In the first image, the red plush toy is positioned to the left of the white box, and the yellow cylindrical container is above the box. In the second image, the white box is on the left side, the red plush toy is lying down to the right of the box, and the yellow cylindrical container is in the foreground. 

The white box is empty in both images. The red plush toy and the yellow cylindrical container are outside the box in both images. The white box has a lattice design and is open at the top. The red plush toy has a soft, rounded shape, and the yellow cylindrical container has a smooth, elongated shape.
