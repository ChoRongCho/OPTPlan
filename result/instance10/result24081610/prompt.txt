Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show four objects and a box. The box is white and has a lattice design. The objects outside the box are as follows:

1. A green 3D cylinder, which appears to be a cap or lid.
2. A transparent 3D cylinder, which looks like a small bottle or container.
3. A white 3D cylinder, which resembles a bowl or a cup.
4. A white 3D cuboid, which is the box itself.

The objects are placed on a flat surface, and the second image provides a side view, confirming the shapes and colors of the objects. The white box is empty, and all the objects are placed outside of it.
