Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show four distinct objects and a white box. The objects are as follows:

1. A green object that is cylindrical in shape, located near the center of the first image and on the right side in the second image.
2. A transparent object that is also cylindrical in shape, positioned to the right of the green cylinder in the first image and lying horizontally in the second image.
3. A white object that is cylindrical in shape, located at the bottom left in the first image and standing upright in the second image.
4. A white object that is cuboid in shape, located at the bottom right in the first image and standing upright in the second image.

The white box is located at the bottom right in the first image and on the left side in the second image. The box is empty in both images.
