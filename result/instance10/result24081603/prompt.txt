Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects and a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is empty. Outside the box, there are three objects. 

1. A green 3D cylinder, which appears to be a bottle cap, is located near the center of the first image and on the right side in the second image.
2. A transparent 3D cylinder, which looks like a small plastic bottle, is positioned to the right of the green cylinder in the first image and in front of the white box in the second image.
3. A white 3D cylinder, which resembles a bowl or a cup, is located below the green cylinder in the first image and to the right of the white box in the second image.

The white box is positioned on the right side of the first image and on the left side in the second image. The objects are arranged around the box, with none of them inside it.
