Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show four distinct objects and a white box. The objects are as follows:

1. A green object that is cylindrical in shape, located near the center of the first image. It is a 3D cylinder.
2. A transparent object that is also cylindrical in shape, located to the right of the green object in the first image. It is a 3D cylinder.
3. A white object that appears to be a bowl or cup, located below the green object in the first image. It is a 3D cylinder.
4. A white object with a lattice design, located to the right of the white bowl in the first image. It is a 3D cuboid.

The white box is located in the bottom right corner of the first image and is empty. The second image provides a side view of the same objects, confirming their shapes and colors. The green cylinder, transparent cylinder, white cylinder, and white cuboid are all outside the box.
