Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design on its sides. It is empty in both images.
2. There is a green object that appears to be a 3D cylinder. It is small and placed near the center of the images.
3. A black object, which is also a 3D cylinder, is visible. It appears to be a roll of tape and is placed to the left of the white box.
4. A large, transparent object is seen in both images. It is a 2D circle, likely a flat disc, and is placed near the center of the images.

These objects are arranged on a light-colored surface, and the white box is positioned towards the right side of the images. The green cylinder and the black cylinder are placed outside the box, along with the transparent circle.
