Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. **Green Object**: This object is a green 3D cylinder. It is small and has a cylindrical shape, as seen from both the top and side views.
2. **Black Object**: This object is a black 3D cylinder. It is larger than the green cylinder and has a cylindrical shape, as observed from both perspectives.
3. **Transparent Object**: This object is a transparent 2D circle. It is flat and circular, clearly visible in the top view and lying flat on the surface in the side view.
4. **White Box**: There is a white box with a lattice design. It is empty in both images and is positioned on the right side of the scene.

The objects are placed outside the white box, which is empty. The green and black cylinders, along with the transparent circle, are all positioned on the flat surface around the box.
