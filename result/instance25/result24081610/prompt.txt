Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. In the first image, a top view is provided, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a white box, a yellow cuboid, a transparent circle, and a transparent cylinder.

1. The white box is located towards the bottom right of the first image and towards the left in the second image. It is a 3D object with a lattice structure.
2. Inside the white box, there is a transparent cylinder. This object is visible in both images, appearing inside the box.
3. The yellow cuboid is positioned to the left of the white box in both images. It is a 3D object with a rectangular shape.
4. The transparent circle is located above the white box in the first image and in front of the box in the second image. It is a 2D object with a circular shape.

These objects are classified based on their dimensions and shapes according to the provided classification table.
