Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. There is a white box with a lattice design, which contains a transparent 3D cylinder. Outside the box, there is a brown 3D cuboid, which appears to be a sponge, and a transparent 2D circle, which looks like a flat disc. The white box is positioned towards the right side of the images, with the transparent cylinder inside it. The brown cuboid is placed to the left of the box, and the transparent circle is positioned in front of the box. The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to classify them according to the given table.
