Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. In the first image, a top view, and the second image, a side view, the objects correspond one-to-one. 

1. **White Box**: There is a white box with a lattice design. The box is empty except for a transparent 3D cylinder inside it. The cylinder appears to be a small container or bottle.

2. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: Outside the box, there is a brown 3D cuboid object, which looks like a sponge or a block. It has a rectangular shape when viewed from the top and a cuboid shape when viewed from the side.

3. **Transparent 2D Circle**: There is a transparent 2D circle object, which appears to be a flat disc or a lid. It is placed on the surface outside the box.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to classify them according to the given table. The white box is the only container in the scene, and it contains the transparent 3D cylinder. The brown 3D cuboid and the transparent 2D circle are placed outside the box.
