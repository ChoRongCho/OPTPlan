Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. In the first image, a top view, and the second image, a side view, the objects correspond one-to-one. 

1. **Box**: There is a white box with a lattice design. It is empty in the first image but contains a transparent cylindrical object in the second image.
2. **Object in Box**: The transparent cylindrical object is inside the white box in the second image. It is a 3D object with a cylindrical shape.
3. **Object Out of Box**: 
   - There is a brown cuboid object, which is a 3D object with a rectangular shape. It is located to the left of the white box in both images.
   - There is a transparent circular object, which is a 2D object with a flat circular shape. It is located in front of the white box in both images.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, and their positions are consistent between the two images.
