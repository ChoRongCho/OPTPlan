Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects and a white box. The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design on its sides. Outside the box, there are four objects:

1. A white 3D cuboid, which is the box itself.
2. A white 3D cylinder, which appears to be a bowl or cup with a fluted design.
3. A white 2D loop, which looks like a rubber band or a looped object.
4. A transparent 3D cylinder, which appears to be a small bottle.

The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. The white box is empty, and all the objects are placed outside of it. The white 3D cuboid (box) is positioned on the right side of the images. The white 3D cylinder (bowl) is placed near the center in the second image. The white 2D loop is located towards the left side, and the transparent 3D cylinder (bottle) is lying down near the white box.
