Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects and a white box. The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design on its sides. Outside the box, there are three objects. The first object is a white 3D cylinder, which appears to be a bowl or cup with a fluted design. The second object is a white 2D loop, which looks like a rubber band or a looped string. The third object is a transparent 3D cylinder, which appears to be a small bottle or container. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view of the scene.
