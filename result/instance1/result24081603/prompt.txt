Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is a brown sponge-like material with a cuboid shape. It is positioned near the center of the first image and to the right in the second image.
2. **Black 3D Cylinder**: This object is a roll of black tape, which has a cylindrical shape. It is located near the top right in the first image and to the left in the second image.
3. **Blue 2D Loop**: This object is a blue elastic band, which forms a loop shape. It is positioned near the bottom left in the first image and in the center in the second image.
4. **White Box**: This is a white plastic box with a lattice design. It is located at the bottom right in the first image and to the left in the second image.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to identify and classify them according to the given classification table.
