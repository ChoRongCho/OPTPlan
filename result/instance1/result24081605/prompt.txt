Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. The yellow object is a 3D cuboid, likely made of a sponge-like material. It is positioned near the center of the first image and on the right side in the second image.
2. The black object is a 3D cylinder, which appears to be a roll of tape. It is located near the top right in the first image and on the left side in the second image.
3. The blue object is a 2D loop, possibly an elastic band. It is situated near the bottom left in the first image and in the center in the second image.
4. The white object is a box, which is empty. It is located on the right side in the first image and on the left side in the second image.

These objects are distinct in shape and color, making them easily identifiable in both images.
