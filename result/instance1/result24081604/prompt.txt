Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The brown object closest to the center of the first image is a 3D cuboid. It has a rectangular shape and appears to be made of a sponge-like material.
2. The black object near the top right of the first image is a 3D cylinder. It is a roll of tape with a black exterior and a red interior.
3. The blue object near the bottom left of the first image is a 2D loop. It is a circular rubber band.
4. The white object near the bottom right of the first image is a box. It is a white plastic container with a lattice design on its sides.

The second image confirms the shapes and colors of these objects from a side perspective, providing additional context for their dimensions and spatial arrangement.
