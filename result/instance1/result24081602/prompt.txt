Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. The brown object in the center of the first image is a 3D cuboid. It appears to be a sponge or foam material and is brown in color.
2. The black object near the top right of the first image is a 3D cylinder. It looks like a roll of tape and is black in color.
3. The blue object near the bottom left of the first image is a 2D loop. It appears to be an elastic band and is blue in color.
4. The white object near the bottom right of the first image is a box. It is white in color and has a lattice design on its sides.

The second image confirms the shapes and colors of these objects from a side view, providing additional perspective on their dimensions and spatial arrangement.
