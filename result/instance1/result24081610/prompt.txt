Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. The objects include a brown cuboid sponge, a black cylindrical roll of tape, a blue loop, and a white box. The brown cuboid sponge is rectangular and has a 3D shape. The black cylindrical roll of tape is circular in cross-section and has a 3D shape. The blue loop is a 2D object, forming a closed curve. The white box is empty and has a lattice design on its sides. The objects are arranged in a way that they do not overlap, making it easy to distinguish each one. The white box is positioned in the lower right corner of the first image and the left side of the second image. The brown cuboid sponge is placed near the center of the first image and the right side of the second image. The black cylindrical roll of tape is located near the top right in the first image and the left side in the second image. The blue loop is near the bottom left in the first image and the center in the second image.
