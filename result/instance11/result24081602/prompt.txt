Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and contains a red object with yellow accents, which appears to be a 3D polyhedron. Outside the box, there are two objects: a white 3D cylinder and a black 3D cylinder. The white 3D cylinder is bowl-shaped, while the black 3D cylinder appears to be a roll of tape. The white box is positioned on the right side of the images, with the red 3D polyhedron inside it. The white 3D cylinder is placed next to the box, and the black 3D cylinder is located near the bottom left corner of the images. The background is a light-colored surface, providing a clear contrast to the objects.
