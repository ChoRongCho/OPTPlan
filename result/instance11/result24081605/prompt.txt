Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and contains a red object that appears to be a polyhedron. Outside the box, there are two cylindrical objects: one is white and the other is black. The white cylinder is positioned to the right of the box, and the black cylinder is located towards the bottom of the image. The white cylinder has a wider opening, resembling a bowl, while the black cylinder is more compact and resembles a roll of tape. The scene is well-lit, and the objects are clearly distinguishable in terms of color and shape.
