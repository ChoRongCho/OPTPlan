Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and contains a green object that appears to be spherical, classifying it as a green 3D sphere. Outside the box, there are three objects. One is a yellow cylindrical object, classifying it as a yellow 3D cylinder. The other two objects are loops: one is blue and the other is white, classifying them as blue 2D loop and white 2D loop, respectively. The blue loop is larger than the white loop. The yellow cylinder is positioned horizontally in both images, and the loops are lying flat on the surface. The white box is positioned upright with the green sphere inside it. The images provide both a top view and a side view, ensuring that the objects' shapes and colors are clearly visible for classification.
