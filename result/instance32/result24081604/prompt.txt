Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and contains a green spherical object, which is classified as a green 3D sphere. Outside the box, there are three objects: a yellow cylindrical object, a blue loop, and a white loop. The yellow object is cylindrical in shape, making it a yellow 3D cylinder. The blue and white loops are flat and circular, classifying them as blue 2D loop and white 2D loop, respectively. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, with the box positioned to the right in the images. The yellow cylinder is placed horizontally, while the loops are lying flat on the surface. The green sphere is inside the box, visible through the lattice design. The scene is well-lit, allowing for clear identification of the objects and their colors.
