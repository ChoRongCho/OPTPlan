Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects, some inside a box and some outside. The box is white and has a lattice design. Inside the box, there is a green object that appears to be a 2D circle. Outside the box, there are three objects: a yellow 3D cylinder, a blue 2D loop, and a white 2D loop. The yellow 3D cylinder is elongated and has a consistent circular cross-section. The blue 2D loop and the white 2D loop are both circular in shape but lie flat, indicating they are loops rather than solid circles. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view for better understanding of their dimensions and shapes.
