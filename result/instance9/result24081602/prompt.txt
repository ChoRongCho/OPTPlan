Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. In the first image, a top view, and the second image, a side view, the objects correspond one-to-one between the two images. 

1. The green object closest to the center of the first image is a green 3D cylinder. This is confirmed by the side view in the second image, where the green object appears cylindrical.
2. The white object to the left in the first image is a white 3D cylinder. This is confirmed by the side view in the second image, where the white object appears bowl-shaped, indicating a cylindrical form.
3. The white object to the right in the first image is a white 3D cuboid. This is confirmed by the side view in the second image, where the white object appears as a box with a lattice structure.
4. Inside the white box, there is a yellow 2D triangle. This is confirmed by the side view in the second image, where the yellow object appears flat and triangular.

The white box is identified as a white_box.
