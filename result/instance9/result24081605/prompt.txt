Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the given images, there are several objects with distinct shapes and colors. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **Green 3D Cylinder**: This object is located near the center of the first image and at the bottom right in the second image. It is green in color and cylindrical in shape, as seen from the side view.

2. **White 3D Cuboid**: This object is a white container with a lattice design. It is positioned on the right side of the first image and on the left side in the second image. The shape is cuboidal, as it has volume and a rectangular base.

3. **Yellow 2D Triangle**: This object is inside the white cuboid box. It is yellow in color and triangular in shape, as seen from the top view in the first image and the side view in the second image.

The white box is a cuboid container with a lattice design, and it contains the yellow triangular object. The green cylinder and the white cuboid are outside the box.
