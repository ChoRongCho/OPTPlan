Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. In the first image, a top view, and the second image, a side view, the objects correspond one-to-one. 

1. **Green 3D Cylinder**: This object is green and cylindrical. It is located near the center of the first image and at the bottom right in the second image.
2. **White 3D Cylinder**: This object is white and cylindrical. It is located to the left in the first image and in the middle of the second image.
3. **White Box**: This is a white box with a lattice design. It is located on the right side in both images.
4. **Yellow 2D Triangle**: This object is yellow and triangular. It is inside the white box in both images.

The white box contains the yellow 2D triangle, while the green 3D cylinder and white 3D cylinder are outside the box. The white box itself is also outside the box.
