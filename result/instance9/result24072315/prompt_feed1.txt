# Wrong Part
4. Planning State

# Analysis using given error
# a) The preconditions for the `fold` action are not satisfied because `object2` is already in the box.
# b) The effect of the `fold` action is correct, but it should not be executed when the object is in the box.
# c) No syntax errors in the action codes.
# d) The goal state in the assert part is correct.
# e) The order of robot actions is incorrect because the `fold` action should not be performed on an object that is already in the box.
# f) The `fold` action on `object2` is unnecessary and incorrect in this context.

# Modified Code (Make the part only)
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, using goal table, describe the initial state and final state of each object
    # Initial State:
    # object0: out_box, not in bin, not packed
    # object1: out_box, not in bin, not packed
    # object2: in_box, not packed
    # object3: box, contains object2, not packed

    # Goal State:
    # object0: in_bin, packed
    # object1: in_bin, packed
    # object2: in_bin, folded, packed
    # object3: box, contains object0, object1, object2, not packed

    # Second, using given rules and object's states, make a task planning strategy
    # 1. Pick and place the white_3D_cylinder (object0) into the box.
    # 2. Pick and place the green_3D_cylinder (object1) into the box.
    # 3. Push the white_3D_cylinder (object0) in the box.
    # 4. Push the green_3D_cylinder (object1) in the box.
    # 5. Push the yellow_2D_rectangle (object2) in the box.

    # Third, make an action sequence. You should be aware of the robot action effects such as 'push' or 'out'. 
    # a) Initialize the robot
    robot = Robot()

    # b) Define the box
    box = object3

    # c) Perform the actions
    # Pick and place the white_3D_cylinder (object0) into the box
    robot.pick(object0, box)
    robot.place(object0, box)

    # Pick and place the green_3D_cylinder (object1) into the box
    robot.pick(object1, box)
    robot.place(object1, box)

    # Push the white_3D_cylinder (object0) in the box
    robot.push(object0, box)

    # Push the green_3D_cylinder (object1) in the box
    robot.push(object1, box)

    # Push the yellow_2D_rectangle (object2) in the box
    robot.push(object2, box)

    # Fourth, after making all actions, fill your reasons according to the rules
    # Reason:
    # 1. Pick and place the white_3D_cylinder (object0) because it is soft and should be placed before any rigid object (Rule 5).
    # 2. Pick and place the green_3D_cylinder (object1) because it is rigid and should be placed after a soft object (Rule 2).
    # 3. Push the white_3D_cylinder (object0) to ensure it is properly placed in the bin (Rule 5).
    # 4. Push the green_3D_cylinder (object1) to ensure it is properly placed in the bin (Rule 5).
    # 5. Push the yellow_2D_rectangle (object2) to ensure it is properly placed in the bin (Rule 5).

    # Finally, check if the goal state is satisfying goal state table. Use a template below. These are examples. 
    assert object0.in_box == True
    assert object1.in_box == True
    assert object2.in_box == True
    assert object2.folded == True
    assert object3.in_bin_objects == [object2, object0, object1]
    print("All task planning is done")
