Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the images provided, there are several objects with distinct shapes and colors. The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design, and it contains a yellow object that appears to be a 2D triangle. Outside the box, there is a green 3D cylinder and a white 3D cuboid. The green cylinder is small and has a smooth surface, while the white cuboid has a ribbed texture and is bowl-shaped. The white box is positioned on the right side of the images, and the green cylinder and white cuboid are placed outside the box on the surface. The yellow triangle is inside the white box, visible through the lattice design.
