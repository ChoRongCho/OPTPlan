Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects include a brown cuboid, a yellow cylinder, a green cylinder, and a black loop inside a white box.

1. The brown cuboid is a rectangular, sponge-like object with a rough texture. It is flat and has a 3D shape.
2. The yellow cylinder is a solid object with a circular base and a consistent height, resembling a tube.
3. The green cylinder is a smaller, solid object with a circular base and a consistent height, resembling a cap.
4. The black loop is a circular object with a hollow center, placed inside a white box with a lattice design.

The white box is open at the top and has a lattice pattern on its sides. The black loop is the only object inside the box, while the other objects are placed outside the box on the flat surface.
