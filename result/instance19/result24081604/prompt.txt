Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box is visible in both images and has a lattice design. Inside the box, there is a black object that appears to be a 2D loop. Outside the box, there are three objects: a brown 3D cuboid, a yellow 3D cylinder, and a green 3D cylinder. The brown cuboid has a rough texture and is rectangular in shape. The yellow cylinder is smooth and has a consistent yellow color. The green cylinder is smaller and has a translucent green color. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view of the scene.
