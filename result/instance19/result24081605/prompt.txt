Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects on a flat surface. The objects include a white box, a yellow cylinder, a green circle, a brown cuboid, and a black loop. The white box is open and has a lattice design on its sides. Inside the box, there is a black loop. Outside the box, there is a yellow cylinder, which is a 3D object with a circular base and height. There is also a green circle, which is a flat 2D object. Additionally, there is a brown cuboid, which is a 3D object with rectangular faces. The objects are arranged in a way that allows for easy identification of their shapes and colors. The white box is positioned to the right in the images, with the black loop inside it. The yellow cylinder, green circle, and brown cuboid are placed outside the box, with the yellow cylinder being the closest to the center of the first image.
