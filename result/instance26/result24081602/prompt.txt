Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the images provided, there are several objects that can be identified and classified according to their shapes and colors. The first object is a red 3D polyhedron, which appears to be a plush toy with wings. It is red in color with yellow accents. The second object is a transparent 3D cylinder, which looks like a plastic bottle. The third object is a white 2D circle, which appears to be a flat, circular object, possibly a lid or a disc. 

The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design on its sides. It is white in color and has a rectangular opening on one side. The objects are placed around the box, with none of them inside it. The red polyhedron and the transparent cylinder are placed outside the box, and the white circle is also outside the box. The images show different perspectives of the same scene, with the objects maintaining their relative positions.
