Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. **Red 3D Polyhedron**: This object is a red plush toy resembling a dragon, which can be classified as a polyhedron due to its complex shape and volume. It is located outside the box in both images.

2. **White 2D Circle**: This object is a flat, circular, white item, likely a lid or a disc. It is positioned near the center of the first image and on the surface in the second image.

3. **Transparent 3D Cylinder**: This object is a transparent plastic bottle, which has a cylindrical shape. It is seen upright in the first image and lying down in the second image.

4. **White Box**: The box is white and has a lattice design. It is empty in both images and is positioned towards the bottom right in the first image and towards the left in the second image.

The objects correspond one-to-one between the two images, maintaining their relative positions and orientations.
