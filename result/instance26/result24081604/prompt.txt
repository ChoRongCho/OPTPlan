Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a red plush toy, a white circular object, a transparent cylindrical object, and a white box.

1. The red plush toy is a 3D cuboid in shape and is positioned outside the box in both images.
2. The white circular object is a 2D circle and is also outside the box in both images.
3. The transparent cylindrical object is a 3D cylinder and is outside the box in both images.
4. The white box is empty in both images.

The white box has a lattice design on its sides and is positioned towards the bottom left in the second image and the bottom right in the first image. The red plush toy is lying next to the box in the second image and is standing upright in the first image. The white circular object is flat on the surface in both images, and the transparent cylindrical object is lying down in the second image and standing upright in the first image.
