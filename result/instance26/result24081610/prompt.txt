Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene are as follows:

1. A red object resembling a dragon with wings, which is classified as a red_3D_sphere due to its overall rounded shape.
2. A transparent object that appears flat and circular, classified as a transparent_2D_circle.
3. A white cylindrical object, classified as a white_3D_cylinder.
4. A white box with a lattice design, classified as a white_box.

The red dragon-like object is positioned outside the box in both images. The transparent circular object is also outside the box, lying flat on the surface. The white cylindrical object is outside the box as well. The white box is empty in both images.
