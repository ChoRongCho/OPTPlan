Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. The red object with yellow wings is a plush toy, which can be classified as a red_3D_sphere due to its overall rounded shape.
2. The transparent object is a plastic bottle, which can be classified as a transparent_3D_cylinder.
3. The white object is a flat, circular item, which can be classified as a white_2D_circle.

The white box is present in both images and is empty. The box is white in color and has a lattice design on its sides.
