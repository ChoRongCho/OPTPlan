Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a red 3D polyhedron, a transparent 3D cylinder, and a white 2D circle. 

The red 3D polyhedron is a plush toy with wings, resembling a dragon, and is positioned outside the box in both images. The transparent 3D cylinder is a plastic bottle, also outside the box in both images. The white 2D circle is a flat, circular object, possibly a lid or a disc, and is placed outside the box in both images.

The white box is a rectangular container with a lattice design on its sides. It is empty in both images. The box is positioned on the right side of the scene in the first image and on the left side in the second image. The objects are arranged around the box, with the red polyhedron and the transparent cylinder lying next to it, and the white circle placed in front of it.
