Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects and a white box. The white box is located on the right side of the images. Inside the box, there is a yellow object that appears to be a 3D cuboid. Outside the box, there are two loop-shaped objects. One of the loops is white and the other is black. The white loop is positioned closer to the top of the images, while the black loop is positioned closer to the bottom. The loops are flat and have a 2D shape. The white box has a lattice design on its sides. The scene also includes some mechanical components on the left and right sides, but they are not classified as objects for bin packing. The background is a light-colored surface.
