Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains a white box with a lattice design, which is positioned towards the right side of the images. Inside the box, there is a yellow object that appears to be a 3D cuboid. Outside the box, there are two loop-shaped objects. One of the loops is white and the other is black. These loops are flat and can be classified as 2D objects. The white loop is positioned closer to the top of the images, while the black loop is closer to the bottom. The white box is the only container in the scene, and it is placed on a flat surface. The images capture the same scene from different angles, providing a comprehensive view of the objects and their spatial arrangement.
