Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design, visible in both images. It is empty.
2. A white 3D cylinder (a bowl) is placed outside the box. It has a circular base and vertical sides.
3. A black 3D cylinder (a roll of tape) is also outside the box. It has a circular base and vertical sides.
4. A green 3D cylinder (a small cap) is placed outside the box. It has a circular base and vertical sides.
5. A translucent 2D circle (a flat, round object) is placed outside the box. It is flat and circular in shape.

The objects are arranged in a way that makes it easy to distinguish their shapes and colors. The white box is the only container, and it is currently empty.
