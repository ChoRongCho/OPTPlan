Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design, visible in both images. It is empty.
2. A white 3D cylinder (bowl-like object) is present, which is closest to the center in the first image and to the right of the box in the second image.
3. A black 3D cylinder (tape roll) is seen near the center in the first image and in front of the box in the second image.
4. A green 3D cylinder (small cap) is visible near the top right in the first image and in front of the box in the second image.
5. A transparent 2D circle (flat disc) is seen near the top left in the first image and to the right of the green cylinder in the second image.

These objects are identified based on their shapes and colors, adhering to the provided classification table.
