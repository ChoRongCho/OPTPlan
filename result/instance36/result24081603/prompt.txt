Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The white box is a cuboid with a lattice design, visible in both images. It is empty.
2. The object closest to the center in the first image is a black 3D cylinder (tape roll) with a beige inner ring. This object is also visible in the second image.
3. To the right of the black cylinder in the first image is a small green 3D cylinder (cap), which is also visible in the second image.
4. The large transparent object in the first image is a 2D circle (flat disc), which is also visible in the second image.
5. The white object at the bottom left in the first image is a 3D cylinder (bowl), which is also visible in the second image.

These objects are classified based on their dimensions and shapes according to the provided classification table.
