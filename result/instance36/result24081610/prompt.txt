Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The white box is a 3D cuboid with a lattice design on its sides. It is empty in both images.
2. There is a white 3D cylinder (a bowl) located to the right of the white box.
3. A black 3D cylinder (a roll of tape) is placed in front of the white box.
4. A green 3D cylinder (a cap) is positioned in front of the black 3D cylinder.
5. A large white 2D circle (a flat disc) is located to the right of the green 3D cylinder.
6. Another white 2D circle (a flat disc) is located to the left of the white box.

These objects vary in shape and color, with the white box being the only container among them.
