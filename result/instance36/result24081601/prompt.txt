Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. The objects are as follows:

1. A white box with a lattice design, which is empty.
2. A white cylindrical object, likely a bowl or cup, placed outside the box.
3. A black cylindrical object, which appears to be a roll of tape, placed outside the box.
4. A green cylindrical object, possibly a cap or small container, placed outside the box.
5. A transparent circular object, which is flat and likely a lid or disc, placed outside the box.

The white box is the only container in the scene, and it is empty. The other objects are all placed outside the box. The white cylindrical object is positioned to the right of the box, the black cylindrical object is in front of the box, the green cylindrical object is to the left of the black cylinder, and the transparent circular object is to the right of the black cylinder.
