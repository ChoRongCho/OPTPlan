Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is positioned on the right side of the images. Inside the box, there is a black 2D circle. Outside the box, there are several objects: a yellow 3D cylinder, a white 2D loop, and a blue 2D loop. The yellow 3D cylinder is positioned near the center of the images and has a cylindrical shape. The white 2D loop is located near the top center of the images, and the blue 2D loop is near the bottom center. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view of the scene.
