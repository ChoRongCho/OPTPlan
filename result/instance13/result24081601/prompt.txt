Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. **White 2D Loop**: This object is located at the top left in the first image and on the right side in the second image. It is a loop, which is a 2D shape related to plane or flatness.

2. **Yellow 2D Rectangle**: This object is positioned at the top right in the first image and on the left side in the second image. It is a flat, rectangular piece of material, which is a 2D shape.

3. **Transparent 2D Circle**: This object is near the center in the first image and slightly to the right in the second image. It is a flat, circular object, which is a 2D shape.

4. **White Box**: This object is located at the bottom right in the first image and on the left side in the second image. It is a 3D cuboid shape, but only the color of the box is specified as per the instructions.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to classify them according to the given table.
