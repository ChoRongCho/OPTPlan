Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The objects are as follows:

1. A white 2D loop, which appears to be a circular band or ring, is located at the top left of the first image and the right side of the second image.
2. A yellow 2D rectangle, which is a flat, rectangular piece of material, is located at the top center of the first image and the bottom left of the second image.
3. A transparent 2D circle, which appears to be a flat, circular object, is located at the bottom left of the first image and the center of the second image.
4. A white box, which is a 3D object with a lattice design, is located at the bottom right of the first image and the left side of the second image.

The white box is empty, and the other objects are placed outside of it. The white loop, yellow rectangle, and transparent circle are all flat objects with distinct shapes and colors.
