Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The objects are as follows:

1. **White 2D Loop**: This object is a white loop, which is a 2D shape. It is located towards the top left of the first image and the right side of the second image.
2. **Yellow 2D Rectangle**: This object is a yellow rectangle, which is a 2D shape. It is located towards the top right of the first image and the bottom left of the second image.
3. **Transparent 2D Circle**: This object is a transparent circle, which is a 2D shape. It is located towards the bottom left of the first image and the center of the second image.
4. **White Box**: This is a white box, which is a 3D shape. It is located towards the bottom right of the first image and the left side of the second image.

The objects correspond one-to-one between the two images, with the first image providing a top view and the second image providing a side view. The white box is empty, and the other objects are placed outside the box.
