Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. **White 2D Loop**: This object is located at the top left of the first image and the right side of the second image. It is a flat, loop-shaped object, likely made of a flexible material.

2. **Yellow 2D Rectangle**: Positioned at the top right of the first image and the bottom left of the second image, this object is a flat, rectangular piece of material. It is bright yellow in color.

3. **Transparent 2D Circle**: This object is near the center of the first image and slightly to the right in the second image. It is a flat, circular object that is transparent, making it somewhat difficult to see against the background.

4. **White Box**: The box is located at the bottom right of the first image and the left side of the second image. It is a white, open-top box with a lattice design on the sides. The box is empty in both images.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, making it easy to classify them according to the provided table.
