Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. **White 2D Loop**: This object is an elongated loop, appearing white in color. It is located near the top left corner in the first image and on the right side in the second image.
2. **Yellow 2D Rectangle**: This object is a flat, rectangular piece, yellow in color. It is positioned near the top right corner in the first image and on the left side in the second image.
3. **Transparent 2D Circle**: This object is a flat, circular shape, transparent in color. It is located near the bottom left corner in the first image and on the right side in the second image.
4. **White Box**: This is a three-dimensional object, white in color, with a lattice design. It is located near the bottom right corner in the first image and on the left side in the second image.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors, and their positions are consistent between the two images.
