Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The objects are as follows:

1. A white loop, which is a 2D shape, located towards the top left of the first image and the right side of the second image. It is a simple loop with no volume.
2. A yellow rectangle, which is a 2D shape, located towards the top right of the first image and the left side of the second image. It is flat and rectangular in shape.
3. A transparent circle, which is a 2D shape, located towards the bottom left of the first image and the center of the second image. It is flat and circular in shape.
4. A white box, which is a 3D shape, located towards the bottom right of the first image and the left side of the second image. The box is empty and has a lattice design on its sides.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, and their positions are consistent between the two images.
