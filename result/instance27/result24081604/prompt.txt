Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. The transparent object near the center of the first image and lying on its side in the second image is a transparent 3D cylinder.
2. The white object with a fluted edge, seen near the bottom center in the first image and standing upright in the second image, is a white 3D cylinder.
3. The flat, circular object near the top center in the first image and lying flat in the second image is a white 2D circle.
4. The white object with a lattice design, seen on the right side in the first image and standing upright in the second image, is a white 3D cuboid.

The box in the images is white and has a lattice design, visible in both images. The objects are placed outside the box.
