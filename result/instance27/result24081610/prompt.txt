Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects, with the first image providing a top view and the second image offering a side view. The objects are as follows:

1. A transparent 3D cylinder, which appears to be a small bottle or container, is located near the center-right of the first image and lying down in the second image.
2. A white 3D cylinder, resembling a bowl or cup, is located at the bottom-left in the first image and standing upright in the second image.
3. A white 2D circle, which appears to be a flat disc or lid, is located at the top-center in the first image and lying flat in the second image.
4. A white 3D cuboid, which is a box with a lattice design, is located at the bottom-right in the first image and standing upright in the second image.

The white box is empty and is used to contain or organize the other objects. The objects are distinguished by their shapes and colors, with the transparent cylinder, white cylinder, white circle, and white cuboid being the primary items of interest.
