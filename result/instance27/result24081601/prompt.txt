Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Please answer with the template below:

Answer
---
object in box:  # if nothing is in the box, leave this answer blank
object out box: brown_3D_cuboid, black_3D_circle  # this is an example
box: white_box # specify only the color of the box

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects from a top view and a side view. The objects are placed on a flat surface, and there is a white box in the scene.

1. The white box is visible in both images. It has a lattice design and is open at the top. Inside the box, there is a yellow 3D cuboid object.
2. Outside the box, there is a white 3D cylinder, which appears to be a bowl or cup. It is placed next to the box.
3. There is a transparent 3D cylinder, which looks like a small bottle or container, placed near the white box.
4. A white 2D circle, which appears to be a flat disc or lid, is also present in the scene.
5. Additionally, there is another white 3D cuboid object, which is placed next to the white box.

The objects are arranged in a way that allows for easy identification of their shapes and colors. The classification table has been used to categorize the objects based on their dimensions and shapes.
