Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
The images show a collection of objects from a top view and a side view. The objects are placed on a flat surface, and there is a white box in the scene. The objects outside the box include a transparent 3D cylinder, which appears to be a small bottle or container. There is also a white 3D cylinder, which looks like a bowl or cup. Additionally, there is a white 2D circle, which seems to be a flat, circular object, possibly a lid or a disc. Lastly, there is a white 3D cuboid, which is a box with a lattice design on its sides. The white box in the scene is empty and has a similar lattice design. The objects are arranged in a way that allows for clear identification of their shapes and colors.
