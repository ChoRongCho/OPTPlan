Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains several objects both inside and outside a white box. Inside the white box, there is a red object that appears to be a 3D polyhedron. Outside the box, there are three objects: a yellow 2D rectangle, a brown 3D cuboid, and a blue 2D loop. The yellow rectangle is flat and lies on the surface, while the brown cuboid has a spongy texture and is placed next to the yellow rectangle. The blue loop is a circular band lying flat on the surface. The white box has a lattice structure and contains the red polyhedron. The objects are arranged in a way that makes it easy to distinguish their shapes and colors.
