Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box contains a red object that appears to be a 3D polyhedron. Outside the box, there are three distinct objects. The first object is a yellow 2D rectangle, which is flat and rectangular in shape. The second object is a brown 3D cuboid, which has volume and a rectangular prism shape. The third object is a blue 2D loop, which is circular and flat. The images provide both a top view and a side view of the scene, allowing for a clear identification of the objects' shapes and colors.
