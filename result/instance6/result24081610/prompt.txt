Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains several objects, both inside and outside a white box. Inside the white box, there is a red object that appears to be a 3D polyhedron. Outside the box, there is a yellow 2D rectangle, which is flat and placed on the surface. Additionally, there is a transparent 3D cylinder, which is likely a bottle, lying on its side. The white box itself has a lattice design and is used to contain the red polyhedron object. The yellow rectangle is positioned flat on the surface, and the transparent cylinder is placed next to the box. The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, making it easy to classify them according to the given table.
