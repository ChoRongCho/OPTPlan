Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with three distinct objects and a white box. The first object is a red 3D polyhedron, which is placed inside the white box. This object has a complex shape with multiple faces and is predominantly red in color. The second object is a yellow 2D rectangle, which is flat and rectangular in shape. It is placed outside the box and is yellow in color. The third object is a transparent 3D cylinder, which is also outside the box. This object has a cylindrical shape and is transparent, making it see-through. The white box itself has a lattice design and is used to contain the red 3D polyhedron. The scene is captured from both a top view and a side view, providing different perspectives of the objects and their arrangement.
