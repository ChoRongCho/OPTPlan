Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and contains a yellow 2D rectangle, which appears to be a flat object like a piece of cloth or paper. Outside the box, there are three distinct objects. 

1. A black 3D cylinder, which looks like a roll of tape, is present. It has a circular base and height, giving it a cylindrical shape.
2. A transparent 3D cuboid, which resembles a small bottle, is also visible. It has a rectangular base and height, making it a cuboid.
3. A blue 2D loop, which appears to be an elastic band or a looped string, is lying flat on the surface.

These objects are arranged around the white box, with the yellow rectangle being the only item inside the box. The scene is well-lit, and the objects are clearly distinguishable in terms of shape and color.
