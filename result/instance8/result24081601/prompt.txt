Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and contains a yellow 2D rectangle, which appears to be a piece of fabric or paper. Outside the box, there are three objects: a black 3D cylinder, a transparent 3D cuboid, and a blue 2D loop. The black 3D cylinder is likely a roll of tape, the transparent 3D cuboid is a small bottle, and the blue 2D loop is an elastic band or similar object. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the second image provides a side view, confirming the shapes and colors observed in the top view.
