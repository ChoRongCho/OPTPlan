Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. 

1. The white box is located on the right side of the images. It is a 3D object with a lattice design.
2. Inside the white box, there is a white 2D circle, which appears to be a flat, circular object.
3. Outside the box, there is a brown 3D cuboid, which is a rectangular sponge-like object with volume.
4. There are two loops outside the box: one is white and the other is black. Both are 2D loops, indicating they are flat and circular in shape.

The objects are arranged in a way that makes it easy to distinguish their shapes and colors. The white box is the only container, and it holds the white 2D circle. The other objects are placed around the box on the flat surface.
