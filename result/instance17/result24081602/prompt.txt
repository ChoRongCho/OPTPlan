Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects from a top view and a side view. The objects include a white box, a brown cuboid, two loops (one white and one black), and a white circle. The white box is located on the right side of the images and has a lattice design. Inside the box, there is a white circle, which appears to be flat and is classified as a 2D circle. Outside the box, there is a brown cuboid, which is a 3D object with volume. The cuboid is positioned on the left side of the images. Additionally, there are two loops, one white and one black, both of which are 2D objects. The white loop is located at the top left of the images, while the black loop is positioned below it. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images capture their relative positions and orientations.
