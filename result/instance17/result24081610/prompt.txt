Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and is positioned towards the right side of the images. Inside the box, there is a white circular object, which is flat and can be classified as a 2D circle. Outside the box, there are three objects: a brown cuboid, a white loop, and a blue loop. The brown cuboid is a 3D object with a rectangular shape and volume. The white loop and blue loop are both 2D objects, characterized by their circular, ring-like shapes. The white loop is positioned closer to the bottom right, while the blue loop is closer to the center of the images. The brown cuboid is located towards the left side of the images.
