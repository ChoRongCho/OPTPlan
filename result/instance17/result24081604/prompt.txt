Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects and a white box. The objects are as follows:

1. A brown 3D cuboid, which appears to be a sponge or similar material, located outside the box.
2. A white 2D loop, which looks like a rubber band, also outside the box.
3. A black 2D loop, another rubber band, outside the box.
4. A white 2D circle, which appears to be a coffee filter, inside the white box.

The white box is positioned on the right side of the images and has a lattice design. The objects are arranged around the box, with the brown cuboid and loops placed on the surface outside the box. The white circle is inside the box, partially visible through the lattice design. The scene is well-lit, and the objects are clearly distinguishable by their shapes and colors.
