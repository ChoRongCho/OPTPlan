# Wrong Part
4. Planning State

# Analysis using given error
# a) Preconditions satisfy the given rules.
# b) The effects of actions are correct.
# c) There are no syntax errors in the action codes.
# d) The goal state at the assert part is correct.
# e) The order of robot actions is incorrect.
# f) There are unnecessary actions.

The issue lies in the order of actions and the missing push action for the soft object before placing it in the bin. The `push` action should be performed before placing the soft object in the bin.

# Modified Code (Make the part only)

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First, using goal table, describe the final state of each object
    # Goal state:
    # object0 (yellow_3D_cuboid) -> is_in_box: True, is_out_box: False
    # object1 (white_1D_ring) -> is_in_box: True, is_out_box: False
    # object2 (blue_1D_ring) -> is_in_box: False, is_out_box: True
    # object3 (white_2D_circle) -> is_in_box: True, is_out_box: False
    # object4 (white_box) -> is_in_box: True, is_out_box: False (unchanged)

    # Second, make your order, you should be aware of the robot action effects such as 'push' or 'pick_out etc'. 
    # a) Initialize the robot
    robot = Robot()

    # b) Define the bin (box)
    bin = object4

    # Third, after making all actions, fill your reasons according to the rules
    # Rule 1: Never pick and place a box
    # Rule 3: When placing soft objects, the soft objects must be pushed before packed in the bin
    # Rule 4: When a rigid object is in the bin at the initial state, take it out and replace it into the bin

    # Step 1: Pick out the rigid object (white_2D_circle) and place it back
    robot.pick_out(object3, bin)
    robot.place(object3, bin)

    # Step 2: Pick and push the soft object (yellow_3D_cuboid) before placing it in the bin
    robot.pick(object0, bin)
    robot.push(object0, bin)
    robot.place(object0, bin)

    # Step 3: Pick and place the elastic object (white_1D_ring) in the bin
    robot.pick(object1, bin)
    robot.place(object1, bin)

    # Fourth, check if the goal state is satisfying goal state table. Use a template below. These are examples. 
    assert object0.is_in_box == True
    assert object1.is_in_box == True
    assert object2.is_in_box == False
    assert object3.is_in_box == True
    assert object4.is_in_box == True
    print("All task planning is done")
```

The main change is ensuring the `push` action is performed before placing the soft object (yellow_3D_cuboid) in the bin. This satisfies the given rules and ensures the goal state is achieved.
