Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and contains a yellow cylindrical object. Outside the box, there are three objects: a brown cuboid, a green cylinder, and a white cone. The brown cuboid appears to be a sponge or similar material, the green cylinder is likely a bottle cap, and the white cone resembles a cupcake liner or similar item. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view for better understanding of their shapes and dimensions.
