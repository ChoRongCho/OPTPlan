Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The scene contains several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box is located on the right side of the images. Inside the box, there is a yellow object that is cylindrical in shape, making it a yellow_3D_cylinder. Outside the box, there are three objects. The first object is a brown cuboid, which is a brown_3D_cuboid, located to the left of the box. The second object is a green circle, which is a green_2D_circle, located near the center of the images. The third object is a white cylinder, which is a white_3D_cylinder, located in front of the box. The white cylinder has a fluted design, resembling a cupcake liner. The objects are arranged on a flat surface, and the images provide both a top view and a side view of the scene, allowing for clear identification of the shapes and colors of the objects.
