Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects, both inside and outside a white box. The white box has a lattice design and contains a yellow cylindrical object. Outside the box, there are three objects: a brown cuboid, a green cylinder, and a white cylinder. 

The brown cuboid is a sponge-like object with a rectangular shape and a flat surface, making it a 3D cuboid. The green cylinder is a small, circular object with a hollow center, classifying it as a 3D cylinder. The white cylinder is a larger, bowl-like object with a circular opening, also classifying it as a 3D cylinder. 

The white box is positioned on the right side of the images, and the objects are arranged around it. The yellow cylinder inside the box is vertically oriented, while the objects outside the box are placed on a flat surface. The scene is well-lit, allowing for clear identification of the objects and their colors.
