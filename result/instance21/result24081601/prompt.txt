Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. In the first image, a top view, and the second image, a side view, the objects are arranged on a flat surface. 

1. The white box is located on the right side of the images. It is a 3D object with a lattice design.
2. Inside the white box, there is a yellow cylindrical object, which is a 3D cylinder.
3. Outside the box, there is a brown cuboid object, which is a 3D cuboid, located towards the left side of the images.
4. There is a green cylindrical object, which is a 3D cylinder, located near the center of the images.
5. A white cylindrical object, which is a 3D cylinder, is located towards the top right side of the images.

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, and their positions are consistent between the two images.
