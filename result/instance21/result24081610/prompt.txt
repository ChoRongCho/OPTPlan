Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a collection of objects on a flat surface. The first image is a top view, and the second image is a side view of the same scene. 

1. **Green 3D Cylinder**: This object is small, green, and cylindrical. It is located near the center of the first image and to the right in the second image.
2. **White 3D Cone**: This object is white and conical, resembling a cupcake liner. It is located at the top right in the first image and in the foreground in the second image.
3. **Brown 3D Cuboid**: This object is brown and cuboidal, resembling a sponge. It is located to the left in both images.
4. **White 3D Cuboid**: This object is a white cuboid, resembling a basket. It is located at the bottom right in the first image and in the background in the second image.
5. **Yellow 3D Cylinder**: This object is yellow and cylindrical, located inside the white cuboid (basket) in both images.

The white box (basket) contains the yellow 3D cylinder, while the other objects are outside the box.
