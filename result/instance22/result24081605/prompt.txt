Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the given images, there are several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same scene. 

1. The first object, which is closest to the center of the images, is a yellow cylindrical object. It is a 3D shape and appears to be a cylinder based on its round ends and consistent diameter along its length.

2. The second object is a black loop, which is a 2D shape. It is circular and flat, resembling a ring or a loop.

3. There is also a white box with a lattice design visible in both images. The box is empty and has a rectangular shape with an open top.

These objects are placed on a light-colored surface, and the white box is positioned towards the right side of the images. The yellow cylinder and the black loop are outside the box.
