Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

object in box: 
object out box: yellow_3D_cylinder, black_2D_circle
box: white_box

Descriptions about objects in the scene:
In the images provided, there are several objects visible. The first object is a yellow cylinder, which is positioned near the center of the first image and lying on its side in the second image. This object is three-dimensional and has a cylindrical shape. The second object is a black circle, which appears near the top of the first image and on the right side of the second image. This object is two-dimensional and has a circular shape. Additionally, there is a white box with a lattice design visible in both images. The box is empty and is positioned on the right side of the first image and the left side of the second image. The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, making it easy to classify them according to the provided classification table.
