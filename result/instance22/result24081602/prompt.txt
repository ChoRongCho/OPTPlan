Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view. The objects in the scene include a white box, a yellow cylindrical object, and a black loop.

1. The white box is visible in both images. It has a lattice design and is empty.
2. The yellow cylindrical object is positioned near the center of the first image and is lying on its side in the second image. It is a 3D object with a cylindrical shape.
3. The black loop is seen near the top of the first image and is placed on the surface in the second image. It is a 2D object with a loop shape.

The white box is empty, and the yellow cylindrical object and the black loop are outside the box.
