Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. The first object is a red plush toy, which appears to be a dragon. Based on its volume and rounded shape, it can be classified as a red_3D_sphere.
2. The second object is a yellow cylindrical container with a greenish tint in the middle. It is a yellow_3D_cylinder.
3. The third object is a white elastic band, which forms a loop. It is classified as a white_2D_loop.
4. The fourth object is a white box with a lattice design. It is empty in both images and is classified as a white_box.

The objects are arranged around the white box, with the red plush toy and the yellow cylindrical container lying next to it, and the white elastic band placed nearby. The white box is empty and has a lattice design on its sides.
