Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The central object in the first image is a red plush toy, which appears to be a dragon. This object is three-dimensional and can be classified as a red_3D_sphere due to its overall rounded shape. To the right of the plush toy, there is a yellow cylindrical object, which is a yellow_3D_cylinder. Above the plush toy, there is a white loop, which is a white_2D_loop. 

In the second image, the same objects are visible from a side view. The white box is empty and has a lattice design. The red plush toy, yellow cylindrical object, and white loop are all outside the box. The white box itself is a simple container with no objects inside it. 

The objects are clearly distinguishable by their colors and shapes, making it easy to classify them according to the given table. The red plush toy is spherical, the yellow object is cylindrical, and the white object is a loop.
