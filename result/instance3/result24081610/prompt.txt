Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The objects include a red plush toy, a yellow cylindrical object, a white loop, and a white box. The red plush toy is closest to the center of the first image and is a 3D sphere in shape. The yellow cylindrical object is also visible in both images and is a 3D cylinder. The white loop is a 2D loop and is seen in both images as well. The white box is empty and has a lattice design. The objects are arranged in a way that they are easily identifiable in both the top view and the side view images. The red plush toy and the yellow cylindrical object are placed outside the box, while the white loop is also outside the box. The white box is empty and has a lattice design.
