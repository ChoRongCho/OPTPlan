Q: 
The first image shows a top view of an object (the one which is the closest to the center of the image) while the second image shows a side view of them.  
Each view captures the same scene, and the objects appearing in the images correspond one-to-one between the two images.
You need to identify the corresponding pairs of objects in each image, and then distinguish their colors, dimensions, and shapes. 
Define the shape and color of the object through these images. 
Use the simple classification table below for the shape of the object. 
You should match dimension and shape. For example, 3D_circle is not acceptable.

Dim   Description                   Shape
1D    related to lines or length    line
2D    related to plane or flatness  rectangle, circle, loop, triangle, polygon
3D    related to volume             cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, polyhedron, pyramid, sphere

object in box:  # if nothing is in the box, leave this answer blank
object out box: brown_3D_cuboid, black_3D_circle  # this is an example
box: white_box # specify only the color of the box

Descriptions about objects in the scene
The images show a scene with several objects placed on a flat surface. The first image provides a top view, while the second image offers a side view of the same objects. 

1. The first object, closest to the center in the first image, is a red plush toy with wings. From the side view, it appears to be a 3D sphere due to its rounded shape and volume.
2. The second object is a yellow cylindrical container with a greenish tint in the middle. It is clearly a 3D cylinder based on its shape and dimensions.
3. The third object is a white loop, which is a 2D shape due to its flatness and circular form.
4. The fourth object is a white box with a lattice design. It is empty in both images.

The objects are well-defined in terms of their shapes and colors, making it easy to classify them according to the given table. The white box is the only container in the scene, and it is currently empty.
